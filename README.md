# ML-Lab-04---Introduction-to-Data-Visualisation-EDA
Exploring Machine Learning Series


## Lab Overview  
### Objectives

#### Part A)
- Export the final DataFrame that you have created using pd.to_csv method to a file whose name is regno.csv. Load that DataFrame to another a new notebook named Lab2.ipynb.

- Create a dataset with 12 features and 3 classes using make_classification. Name the features F1, F2, ... upto F12.
   - F1: Can hold two values (True/False)
   - F2: Can hold two values (Type 1 or Type 2)
   - F3: Can hold three values (A or B or C)
   - F4: Can hold three values (HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW)
   - Features F5 to F12 will have numeric values generated during the creation process.

#### Part B) 
- Use either of the above datasets to show the usage of distplot, jointplot, pairplot, rugplot, catplot, barplot, countplot, violinplot, striplot, swarmplot and facetgrid plots.

#### Part C) 
- Load the Iris Dataset, and explore - scatterplot, scatter_3d, heatmap, boxplot, kdeplot etc.
- In both the cases, write your observations on the plot outputs and how it is relevant.
